The goal of the Jakarta EE 9.1 release is to deliver a set of specifications functionally equivalent to Jakarta EE 9 and adding the support for the Java SE 11 runtime.

The Platform team sees Jakarta EE 9.1 as an extension to the foundational Jakarta EE 9 release. No API updates are expected in Jakarta EE 9.1. Only the Platform and Web Profile Specifications along with the TCK and Compatible Implementations should be affected by Jakarta EE 9.1.
